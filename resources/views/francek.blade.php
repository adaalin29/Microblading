                years. Born in Germany, from an early age he discovered his strong passion for every aspect of

                20 years ago, he began his studies for permanent make-up. At that time, the results and possibilities of
                permanent make-up did not meet his refined taste and requirements, so he relocated his professional
                specialization more towards hairdressing, marketing and exclusive products for hair care.<br><br>

                the whole world from Branko Babic’s Microblading Academy. Francek Prsa opened his first beauty salon in
                Germany in 1996.<br><br>

                Today, he owns and franchises twelve salons with over 200 employees. Also, he founded and owns the
                Master Academy in Germany where make-up artists and professional hairdressers receive their training.

                The world’s most beautiful people can not do without his professional skills and his guidance any more,

                Nonetheless, FrancekPrsa’s could not give up his search for pure perfection in make-up. Eventually, he
                found the answers he was looking for all these years in the skillful art of Microblading. Like the best
                things in life seem to happen unexpectedly, his entry into the world of PhiBrows took place one ordinary
                day. When visiting his best friend, FrancekPrsa noticed something was different: Her face, which he knew
                very well, seemed to be more beautiful than ever before and amazingly fascinating. Of course, he had to
                ask her where that utmost beauty had come from in such a short span of time. His best friend stated that
                she had just returned from Belgrade, where she had visited Branko Babic and enjoyed a PhiBrows
                treatment. That was back in 2011, when FrancekPrsa learned out about the new technology behind
                Microblading for the very first time. His best friend insisted, that he should take classes and lessons
                in Branko Babic’s famous Microblading Academy. After only one day of practical training for PhiBrows
                treatments, he was delighted with pleasure and from then on he knew he would not be able to withdraw
                from Microblading. Being a hard-working and dedicated person by nature, he learned different techniques
                of Microblading development, new systems of rendering well-shaped eyebrows, and about all types of
                problematic, sensitive skin of the face. Throughout his professional specialization, he has visited
                numerous seminars in Serbia, Germany, France and even was an assistant in the training classes held by
                Branko Babic and his Phibrows Masters.

                Today, Francek Prsa is one of the PhiMasters holding classes in the entire world. All his previous
                knowledge is now redirected to Microblading. He shares his long story of experience and success with his
                students, and even was chosen to clear the way for PhiBrows in the US. The first official class was held
                in New York in April 2016. After that, there were basic seminars and perfection training sessions in
                Miami , New York ,Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. Until now, more than 500 students graduated from the
                PhiAcademy. All of them wanted to learn about how the new PhiBrows tool can create such facial beauty.
                In the Master’s Class, held in Belgrade in September 2016, Francek Prsa and his team received an award
                for their exceptional effort and their important contribution to the quality of PhiBrows’s courses.
